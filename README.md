# ReinforcementLearning

In this project we test different reinforcements learning algorithms using [openAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) API. 

We use [Andrej Karpathy post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) and [David Silver course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) as a reference. We also check [sentdex](https://pythonprogramming.net/openai-cartpole-neural-network-example-machine-learning-tutorial/)

Comparison between [Q-Learning and Policiy-Gradients](https://flyyufelix.github.io/2017/10/12/dqn-vs-pg.html)



## Installation

Only works for Python >=3.5, then, we can install using pip:

`pip install gym`
