# ReinforcementLearning

In this project we test different reinforcements learning algorithms using [openAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) API. 

We use [Andrej Karpathy post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) and [David Silver course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) as a reference
